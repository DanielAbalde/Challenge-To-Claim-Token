<h1 align="center">Challenge to Claim Token (BETA)</h1> 
<p align="center">Claim a token if you know the secret!</p>

<p align="center" style="font-style: italic">‚ö†Ô∏è<small>This project still needs to be audited and used in testnets, use it under your own risk</small>‚ö†Ô∏è</p>

This [contract](./contracts/ChallengeToClaim.sol) allows you to put your ERC721, ERC1155 and ERC20 tokens under challenge, so that whoever finds the answer will be able to claim the token to transfer it to himself. You present a challenge, problem, puzzle, quest or gymkhana, and this contract takes care of the transfer to whomever provides the correct solution.


## üöÄ Motivation

The motivation is to let anyone to offer a more fun alternative to random airdrops or giveaways and to do this type of activity on-chain to automate it and let the transfer (including its gas cost) be handled by the winners instead of the owner.

## üó∫Ô∏è How it works

Each challenge is made up of a prize token, a secret hash, and a unique encrypted signature derived from both using the [EIP712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) standard. The challenger registers the token along with the signature, and the winner must present that signature and its corresponding secret hash, to verify that the prize can be claimed.

```js
  // This is what the challenger does under the hood:
  // 1) Connects to the dapp:
  const owner = "<input address>";
  // 3) Hash the solution to challenge
  const secretKey = ethers.utils.formatBytes32String("secret message or solution");
  // 4) Generate the EIP721 signature
  const signature = await signChallenge(owner, token.address, token.tokenId, token.amount, secretKey);
  // 5) Register a new challenge
  await challengeContract.connect(owner).makeChallengeERC721(token.address, token.tokenId, "", signature);
```

The idea is that you share the signature with the participants, from which they cannot get information because it is encrypted, and give clues or challenges to find the secret hash. This hash can be derived from text, numbers, or bytes, so the solution can be any data type.
 

```js
   // This is what the participant does under the hood:
   // 1) Connects to the dapp:
   const account = "<input address>";
   // 2) Provides the solution to the challenge
   const secretKey = "<input solution>";
   // 3) Provides the signature given by the challenger
   const signature = "<input signature>";
   // 4) If secretKey is correct, claim and receive the token
   await challengeContract.connect(account).claim(secretKey, signature);
```

Because one part of the signature is derived from information determined by the blockchain and the token, it is necessary that the other part, the secretKey, must be unique to each token.
